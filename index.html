        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            Developing the "Lights Out" game was both a technical and creative challenge. The process began with implementing the game's core logic, including toggling tiles and validating win conditions. 
            Ensuring the game started with a solvable random configuration required additional research and the simulation of random clicks on a pristine board.

            Creativity flourished in the design phase. A dark mode with a dynamic gradient background was introduced for a visually captivating experience. The interactive tiles, glowing animations, and starry background enhanced the game's aesthetic appeal, while the responsive layout ensured usability across devices.

            Challenges included managing CSS transitions for hover effects and integrating the dynamic instructions panel. These were resolved by breaking the tasks into manageable parts and using animation properties effectively. 
            Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript game logic, CSS animations, and responsive web design principles.
